## Course Description

The term “linear models” describes a wide class of methods for the statistical analysis of multivariate data. The underlying theory is grounded in linear algebra and multivariate statistics, but applications range from biological research to public policy. The objective of this course is to provide a solid introduction to both the theory and practice of linear models, combining mathematical concepts with realistic examples.
