Welcome to Math 6040/7260: *Linear Models*. Here is some essential information to get started with Math 6040/7260.

## Class webpage

Please bookmark and visit the course webpage frequently for the most updated information:
<https://tulane-math-7260-2022.github.io/>.

## Lecture format

With the COVID-19 pandemic going on, the lectures will be delivered in a hybrid mode.  Exams will be take-home to accommodate any future uncertainties.

I will deliver lectures at Howard-Tilton Memorial Hall 116 and Zoom <https://tulane.zoom.us/j/94748340296> on Mondays and Wednesdays (Mon/Wed 10:55am-11:40am).  Friday classes will be on Zoom only <https://tulane.zoom.us/j/96583956151> that consist a mixture of lectures (first 2/3 weeks) and practical lab sessions.  Lectures will include presentation slides and questions.

## Attendance

I do require attendance.  However, you could attend classes through any of the following format

1. In person (Monday / Wednesday)
2. Zoom (Monday / Wednesday / Friday)
2. Watching zoom recordings


## Grades

There will be one mid-term and one final exam.  There will be roughly 4 sets of homework problems.

All graduate students are required to deliver a 15-min talk (10 min presentation + 5 min questions) on one of the following topics (secure yours before others do).  You may suggest a topic outside of the pool too.  Undergraduate students are encouraged to participate too with bonus 5 points towards the final score.
